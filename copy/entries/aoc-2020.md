Merry Christmas and Happy New Years, to all!

Once again, every year I like to participate in Eric Wastl's *[Advent of
Code][]*!  It's a series of 25 Christmas-themed puzzles that release every day
at midnight --- there's a cute story motivating each one, usually revolving
around saving Christmas.  Every night my friends and I (including the good
people of freenode's `##advent-of-code` channel) talk about the puzzle and
creative ways to solve it (and also see how my [bingo card][] is doing).  The
[subreddit community][] is also pretty great as well!  And an even nicer thing
is that the puzzles are open-ended enough that there are often many ways of
approaching them...including some approaches that can leverage math concepts in
surprising ways, like [group theory][alchemical], [galilean transformations and
linear algebra][gal], and [more group theory][shuffle].  Many of the puzzles
are often simple data transformations that Haskell is especially good at!

Speaking of Haskell, I usually do a write-up for every day I can get around to
about unique insights that solving in Haskell can provide to each different
puzzle.  I did them in [2017][], [2018][], and [2019][], but I never finished
every day.   But 2020 being what it is, I was able to finish! :D

You can find [all of them here][reflections], but here are links to each
individual one.  Hopefully you can find them helpful.  And if you haven't yet, why
not try [Advent of Code][] yourself? :)  And drop by the freenode
##advent-of-code channel, we'd love to say hi and chat, or help out!  Thanks
all for reading, and also thanks to Eric for a great event this year, as
always!

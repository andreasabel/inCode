***Update***: This post was written by me when I was just starting to learn
about type-level things in Haskell, and reflects my own inexperience at the
time of writing it.  I have [released an update][update], which presents what I
hope to be an introduction that is more grounded in modern Haskell and
dependent type idioms.

Original Article (written in 2015)
----------------------------------

Fixed-length vector types (vector types that indicate the length of the vector
in the type itself) are one of the more straightforward applications of the
"super-Haskell" GHC type extensions.  There's a lot of magic you can do with
GHC's advanced type mechanisms, but I think fixed length vectors are a good
first step to beginning to understand several extensions, including
(potentially):

*   ConstraintKinds
*   DataKinds
*   GADTs
*   KindSignatures
*   TypeFamilies
*   TypeOperators
*   OverloadedLists

And using type system plugins.  (And of course the usual
`UndecidableInstances` etc.)  We'll be discussing two different ways to
implement this --- using type-level nats, and using the *GHC.TypeLits* model
to actually be able to use numeric literals in your types.  These things are
seen in the wild like with the popular *[linear][]* package's `V` type.

[linear]: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/linear-1.18.0.1/docs/Linear-V.html

There are a few great tutorials/writeups on this topic, but many of them are
from the time before we had some of these extensions, or only discuss a few.
I hope to provide a nice comprehensive look about the tools available today to
really approach this topic.  That being said, I am no expert myself, so I
would appreciate any tips/edits/suggestions for things that I've missed or
done not-the-best :)  This post has a lot of open questions that I'm sure
people who know more about this than me can answer.

Most of the code in this article can be [downloaded and tried out][allsamps],
so follow along if you want!

The Idea
--------

The basic idea is we'll have a type:

~~~haskell
Vec n a
~~~

Which is a vector with items of type `a`, whose length is somehow encoded in
the `n`.  We'll then discuss ways to do useful operations on this, as if it
were a list.

`n` can really only be a certain "kind" of thing --- a type that encodes a
length.  We can represent this by giving it a "kind signature":

~~~haskell
data Vec :: Nat -> * -> *
~~~

Which says that our `Vec` type constructor takes two arguments: something of
kind `Nat` (so it can't be any type...it has to be a type of kind `Nat`),
something of kind `*` (the "normal" kind, of things that have values, like
`Int`, `Maybe Bool`, etc.), and returns something of kind `*` (our vector
itself).

Using DataKinds for Type-Level Nats
-----------------------------------

(The code in this section for this type is [available online][fvtypenats], if
you wanted to play along!)

!!![fvtypenats]:fixvec/FVTypeNats.hs

There are a couple of ways to find something for that `n` `Nat` kind, and one
way is to use the simple inductive `Nat`:

~~~haskell
!!!fixvec/FVTypeNats.hs "data Nat ="
~~~


You might have seen this type before...it gives us value-level natural
numbers, where `Z` is zero, `S Z` is one, `S (S Z)` is two, `S (S (S Z))` is
three, etc.  So if we had something of type `Nat`, it could represent any
natural number.  This declaration gives you:

*   A type `Nat`
*   A value constructor `Z :: Nat`
*   A value constructor `S :: Nat -> Nat`

However, with the *DataKinds* extension, when you define this, you also define
some extra fancy things.  You also define a *kind* `Nat`!  More specifically,
you get:

*   A kind `Nat`
*   A type `Z :: Nat` (`Z`, of *kind* `Nat`)
*   A type constructor `S :: Nat -> Nat` (`S`, which takes something of kind
    `Nat`, and returns a new thing of kind `Nat`)

(Note that, to be principled, GHC would prefer us to use `'Z` and `'S` when we
are referring to the *types*, and this is how it'll print them out in error
messages.  But we're going to run with this for now...mostly for aesthetic
reasons)

We can check this out in GHCi:

~~~haskell
ghci> :set -XDataKinds
ghci> data Nat = Z | S Nat
ghci> :k Z
Nat
ghci> :k S Z
Nat
ghci> :k S (S Z)
Nat
~~~

So now we have a *type* that can encode numbers.  Something of type `Z`
represents zero...something of type `S Z` represents 1...something of type `S
(S Z)` represents two.

Note that you can't ever have anything like `S Bool`...that doesn't work,
because `Bool` is of kind `*`, but `S` expects only `Nat`s.

Now we can make our `Vec` data type, with the *GADTs* extension, or
"generalized algebraic data types":

~~~haskell
!!!fixvec/FVTypeNats.hs "data Vec ::" "infixr 5 :#" "deriving instance Show a => Show (Vec n a)"
~~~

If you've never seen GADTs before, think of it as a way of declaring a type
by giving the type of your constructors instead of just the normal boring
form.  It's nothing too crazy...it's basically like defining `Maybe` as:

~~~haskell
data Maybe :: * -> * where
    Nothing :: Maybe a
    Just    :: a -> Maybe a
~~~

instead of

~~~haskell
data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
~~~

In both cases, they create constructors of type `Nothing :: Maybe a` and
`Just :: a -> Maybe a` anyway...so the GADT form just gives us a way to state
it explicitly.

Oh, we also used the *KindSignatures* extension to be able to give a
kind signature to `Vec`...this is important because we want to make sure the
first argument has to be a `Nat`.  That is, we can't have anything silly like
`Vec Bool Int`.  We also have to put a separate *StandaloneDeriving*-extension
standalone deriving clause instead of just having `deriving Show` because
`Vec` isn't a type that can be expressed in "normal Haskell".

Note that our type is basically like a list:

~~~haskell
data [] :: * -> * where
    []  :: [a]
    (:) :: a -> [a] -> [a]
~~~

Except now our type constructor actually has a new `Nat`

This means that, because of type erasure, everything "runtime" on our new type
is basically going to be identical to `[]` (not considering compiler tricks).
In-memory, this new type is essentially exactly `[]`, but its type has an
extra tag that is erased at compile-time.

Okay, let's define some useful methods:

~~~haskell
!!!fixvec/FVTypeNats.hs "headV ::" "tailV ::"
~~~

Ah, the classic `head`/`tail` duo from the days pre-dating Haskell.  `head`
and `tail` are somewhat of a sore spot or wart in Haskell's list API[^htgone],
because they're *partial functions*.  You tell people all about how Haskell is
great because it can prevent run-time errors by ensuring completeness and
having the type system enforce null-pointer checks...but then you go ahead and
put unsafe functions that throw errors for empty lists anyways in Prelude.

[^htgone]: Can we get them out of Prelude?  Please? :)

But here...this will never happen!  We can only use `headV` and `tailV` on
non-empty lists...it won't typecheck for empty lists.  Do you see why?

It's because all empty lists are of type `Vec Z a`.  But `headV` and `tailV`
only take things of *type* `Vec (S n) a`, for any `Nat` `n`.  So, if you ever
try to use it on an empty list, it won't even compile!  No more pesky runtime
bugs.  `headV` and `tailV` are safe and will never crash at runtime!

Note that the return type of `tailV` is a vector of a length one less than the
given vector.  `tailV :: Vec (S Z) a -> Vec Z a`, for instance...or `tailV ::
Vec (S (S Z)) a -> Vec (S Z) a`.  Just like we want!

If you tried implementing this yourself, you might notice that you actually
get an *error* from GHC if you even *try* to handle the `Nil` case for `tailV`
or `headV`.  GHC will know when you've handled all possible cases, and get mad
at you if you try to handle a case that doesn't even make sense!

### Type families and appending

We can also "append" vectors.  But we need a way to add `Nat`s together first.
For that, we can use a type family, using the *TypeFamilies* extension (with
`TypeOperators`):

~~~haskell
!!!fixvec/FVTypeNats.hs "type family (x :: Nat) + (y :: Nat)"
~~~

A "type family" is like a type level function.  Compare this to defining `(+)`
on the value level to the `Nat` *data* type:

~~~haskell
!!!fixvec/FVTypeNats.hs "(+#) ::"
~~~

Basically, we're defining a new type-level function `(+)` on two types `x` and
`y`, both of kind `Nat`...and the result is their "sum".  Convince yourself
that this "addition" is actually addition.  Now, let's use it for `appendV`:

~~~haskell
!!!fixvec/FVTypeNats.hs "appendV ::"
~~~

~~~haskell
ghci> let v1 = 1 :# 2 :# 3 :# Nil
ghci> let v2 = 0 :# 1 :# Nil
ghci> v1 `appendV` v2
1 :# 2 :# 3 :# 0 :# 1 :# Nil
ghci> :t v1 `appendV` v2
v1 `appendV` v2 :: Vec (S (S (S (S (S Z))) Int
~~~

### Generating

It'd be nice to have type-safe methods of *generating* these things,
too...functions like `iterate`, or `enumFrom`.  One of the ways to do this is
by using a typeclass. (Available in a [separate file][unfoldable] to try out).

!!![unfoldable]:fixvec/Unfoldable.hs

~~~haskell
!!!fixvec/Unfoldable.hs "class Unfoldable v"
~~~

We're going to call `v` an `Unfoldable` if you can build a `v` from an
"unfolding function" and an "initial state".  Run the function on the initial
value and get the first item and a new state.  Run the function on the new
state and get the second item and the next state.

The list instance should make it more clear:

~~~haskell
!!!fixvec/Unfoldable.hs "instance Unfoldable []"
~~~

~~~haskell
ghci> take 5 $ unfold (\x -> (x `mod` 3 == 2, x^2 - 1)) 2
[True, False, True, False, True]
~~~

Note that we can have an instance for any fixed-length vector type...where the
thing "cuts off" after it's filled the entire vector:

~~~haskell
!!!fixvec/FVTypeNats.hs "instance Unfoldable (Vec Z)" "instance Unfoldable (Vec n) => Unfoldable (Vec (S n))"
~~~

Take a moment to think about what these instances are doing.

You can create a `Vec Z a` from an unfolding function pretty easily, because the
only thing with type `Vec Z a` is `Nil`.  So just ignore the function/initial
state and return `Nil`.

The instance for `Vec (S n)` is slightly more involved.  To make a `Vec (S n)
a`, you need an `a` and a `Vec n a`.  You can get the `a` from the unfolding
function...but where will you get the `Vec n a` from?  Well, you can use
`unfold` to make a `Vec n a`!  But that only makes sense if `Vec n` is an
`Unfoldable`.

So, that's why in the instance for `Vec (S n)`, we constrain that `Vec n` must
also be an `Unfoldable`.  We make our result by using our function to create
an `a` and `unfold` to create a `Vec n a` (provided `Vec n` is an
`Unfoldable`).

Note that this style of declaration looks a lot like induction.  We define our
instance for zero...and then we say, "if `n` is an instance, then so is `S
n`".  Induction!

Let's see this in action.

~~~haskell
!!!fixvec/Unfoldable.hs "replicateU ::" "iterateU ::" "fromListMaybes ::"
~~~

~~~haskell
ghci> replicateU 'a'       :: Vec (S (S (S Z))) Char
'a' :# 'a' :# 'a' :# Nil
ghci> replicateU 'a'       :: Vec Z Char
Nil
ghci> iterateU succ 1      :: Vec (S (S (S (S Z)))) Int
1 :# 2 :# 3 :# 4 :# Nil
ghci> fromListMaybes [1,2] :: Vec (S (S (S Z))) (Maybe Int)
Just 1 :# Just 2 :# Nothing :# Nil
ghci> tailV (iterateU succ 1 :: Vec (S Z) Int)
Nil
~~~

Note that `replicateU` doesn't need to take in an `Int` parameter, like the on
in Prelude, to say how many items to have.  It just replicates enough to fill
the entire vector we want!

### Common Typeclasses

We can go in and implement common typeclasses, too.  All the ones you'd
expect.

We can actually use the *DeriveFunctor* extension to write a `Functor`
instance, but let's write one on our own just for learning purposes:

~~~haskell
!!!fixvec/FVTypeNats.hs "instance Functor (Vec n)"
~~~

For `Applicative`, it isn't so simple.  The Applicative instance is going to
be the "ZipList" instance...so we have to be able to make a `pure` that
depends on the type, and a `(<*>)` that depends on the type, too.

~~~haskell
!!!fixvec/FVTypeNats.hs "instance Applicative (Vec Z)" "instance Applicative (Vec n) => Applicative (Vec (S n))"
~~~

For `Vec Z`, it's just `Nil`.  For `Vec (S n)`...for pure, you need `x :#`
something...and that something has to be a `Vec n a`.  That's just `pure` for
`Vec n`!  Remember, we can't assume that `Vec n` is an `Applicative` just
because `Vec (S n)` is. So we need to add a constraint, that `Vec n` an
Applicative. Induction, again!

For `(<*>)`, we can get the first item easily, it's just `f x`.  But for the
next item, we need a `Vec n a`.  Luckily...we have exactly that with the
`(<*>)` for `Vec n`!

Remember, at the end, we're saying "We have an `Applicative` instance for
*any* type `Vec n`".  The instance for `Vec Z` has `pure _ = Nil`.  The
instance for `Vec (S Z)` has `pure x = x :# Nil`.  The instance for `Vec (S (S
Z))` has `pure x = x :# x :# Nil`, etc. etc.

~~~haskell
ghci> fmap (*2) (1 :# 2 :# 3 :# Nil)
2 :# 4 :# 6 :# Nil
ghci> pure 10 :: Vec (S (S Z)) Int
10 :# 10 :# Nil         -- like replicateV!
ghci> liftA2 (+) (1 :# 2 :# 3 :# Nil) (100 :# 201 :# 302 :# Nil)
101 :# 203 :# 305 :# Nil
~~~

I'll leave the `Monad` instance as an exercise, but it's in the source files
for this post.  `join` for this instance should be a "diagonal" --- the first
item of the first vector, the second item of the second vector, the third item
of the third vector, etc.

We can define `Foldable` and `Traversable` the same way.  Like for `Functor`,
GHC can derive these with *DeriveFoldable* and *DeriveTraversable*...but we'll
do it again here just to demonstrate.

~~~haskell
!!!fixvec/FVTypeNats.hs "instance Foldable (Vec Z)" "instance Foldable (Vec n) => Foldable (Vec (S n))" "instance Traversable (Vec Z)" "instance Traversable (Vec n) => Traversable (Vec (S n))"
~~~

Note that we can only use `foldMap f xs` on `xs :: Vec n a`, if `Vec n` is a
`Foldable`.  So that's why we add that constraint.

Again, `liftA2 (:#) :: Applicative f => f a -> f (Vec n a) -> f (Vec (S n)
a)`...so this only makes sense if `traverse f s` gives us a `Vec n a`.  So we
have to add that as a constraint.

~~~haskell
ghci> toList $ 1 :# 2 :# 3 :# Nil
[1,2,3]
ghci> traverse Identity $ 1 :# 2 :# 3 :# Nil
Identity (1 :# 2 :# 3 :# Nil)
ghci> sequence_ $ putStrLn "hello" :# putStrLn "world" :# Nil
"hello"
"world"
ghci> sequence $ Just 1 :# Just 2 :# Nil
Just (1 :# 2 :# Nil)
ghci> sequence $ Just 1 :# Nothing :# Nil
Nothing
~~~

`Traversable` of course opens a whole lot of doors.  For example, we can write
a "safe `fromList`":

~~~haskell
!!!fixvec/Unfoldable.hs "fromListU ::"
~~~

~~~haskell
ghci> fromListU [1,2,3] :: Maybe (Vec (S Z) Int)
Just (1 :# Nil)
ghci> fromListU [1,2,3] :: Maybe (Vec (S (S (S Z))) Int)
Just (1 :# 2 :# 3 :# Nil)
ghci> fromListU [1,2,3] :: Maybe (Vec (S (S (S (S Z)))) Int)
Nothing
~~~

And, if you're on GHC 7.8+, you have access to the *OverloadedLists* language
extension, where you can interpret list literals as if they were other
structures.

We've already already implemented both `fromList` and `toList`, in a way,
already, so this should be a breeze.  The only trick you might see is that the
`IsList` typeclass asks for a type family to return the *type of the element
in the container* from the container type.

~~~haskell
!!!fixvec/FVTypeNats.hs "instance (Unfoldable (Vec n), Traversable (Vec n)) => L.IsList (Vec n a)"
~~~

~~~haskell
ghci> :set -XOverloadedLists
ghci> [1,2,3] :: Vec (S (S Z)) Int
1 :# 2 :# Nil
ghci> [1,2,3] :: Vec (S (S (S (S Z)))) Int
*** Exception: Demanded vector from a list that was too short.
ghci> [1,3..] :: Vec (S (S (S (S Z)))) Int
1 :# 3 :# 5 :# 7 :# Nil
~~~

Neat!  All of the benefits of list literals that *OverloadedLists* offers is
now available to us.[^impossible]  Unfortunately, you now open yourself up to
runtime errors, so...it's actually a really bad idea for safety purposes
unless you stick to only using it with infinite lists or are very disciplined.
(Unless you really want to use list syntax, `fromListU` is probably a safer
choice for finite lists!)

[^impossible]: By the way, the GHC wiki seems to claim that [using
*OverloadedLists* this way is impossible][olimp].  Anyone know what's going on
here?  Did we move fast and break everything?

[olimp]: https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/OverloadedLists#Length-indexedobservedVectors


### Indexing

It'd be nice to be able to index into these, of course.  For type-safe
indexing, we can take advantage of a trick using the `Proxy`
type.

Many might remember having to get a `TypeRep` for a `Typeable` instance by
doing something like `typeOf (undefined :: IO Double)`.  That's because
`typeOf :: Typeable a => a -> TypeRep`.  If you wanted to get the `typeRep`
for an `IO Double` using `typeOf`, you have to pass in an `IO Double`.  But if
you don't have one at hand, you can just use `undefined` with a type
annotation.  It's a bit of a dirty hack, but it works because `typeOf` doesn't
care about the first argument's value...just its type.

These days, we like to be a bit less embarrassing and use something called
`Proxy`:

~~~haskell
data Proxy a = Proxy
~~~

`Proxy a` is a bit like `()`.  It only has one constructor, and doesn't take
any arguments.  But we can use the type signature to "pass in types" to
functions, as "arguments".

We have a couple of options here.  One is to make a typeclass for type level
nats to turn them into an `Integer` or a value-level `Nat`, and then do an
"unsafe indexing" after verifying, through types, that the index is smaller
than the length.

However, this is a little bit silly because we're just doing an unsafe
indexing in the end anyway, so the compiler can't help us at all.  Wouldn't it
be nice if we could get the compiler on our side and write a *real* safe
index?

There are many ways to approach this problem, but one way is to make a
specific `Index` typeclass: (or make another typeclass like `Take`, and write
`index` in terms of it)

~~~haskell
!!!fixvec/FVTypeNats.hs "class Index"
~~~

Here, we can say that `n` and `v` are instances of `Index n v` if and only if
you can safely (totally) index into `v a` at index `n`.  That is, if every
value of type `v a` ever has an index at `n`, a `Nat`. (By the way, we need
*MultiParamTypeClasses* to be able to make a type class with two parameters)

So, `n ~ S Z` and `v ~ Vec (S (S Z)) a` has an instance, because you can get
the $n = 1$ element (the second element) from *any* value of type `Vec (S (S
Z)) a` (a length-two vector).

But `n ~ S Z` and `v ~ Vec (S Z) a` does *not*.  There are actually *no*
length-1 vectors that have a $1$ index (second element).

Note that we use the `Proxy` trick we discussed, so that we can indicate
somehow what index we really want.  It is a trick that basically allows us to
pass a *type* (`S Z`, `S (S Z)`, etc.) as a "value".

Let's write our instances --- but only the instances that *make sense*.

~~~haskell
!!!fixvec/FVTypeNats.hs "instance Index Z (Vec (S n))" "instance forall n m. Index n (Vec m) => Index (S n) (Vec (S m))"
~~~

The first case instance makes sense.  We can definitely index at index `Z`
(zero) of *any* `Vec (S n) a` --- the only thing we can't index `Z` into is
`Vec Z a`. So, if our vector is of length 1 or higher, we can index at
position 0.

The second case says that, if we can index into `n` of a `Vec m a`, then of
course we can index into an `S n` of a `Vec (S m) a`.  To index into `S n` of
a `Vec (S m) a`, all we need to do is index into `n` of the `Vec m a` tail!

We have to use the *ScopedTypeVariables* extension to enable us to use, with
the `forall` statement, the `n` in our instance when we are writing our type
for `Proxy`.  If we didn't, the `n` in `Proxy n` in our `index` definition
would be considered unrelated by GHC to the `n` in the instance statement,
`Index (S n) (Vec (S m))`.  (This is the only reason we need the `forall`)

In any case, note the similarity of this algorithm to the actual indexing
function on lists:

~~~haskell
0 !! (x:_ ) = x
n !! (_:xs) = (n - 1) !! xs
~~~

trying it out...

~~~haskell
ghci> index (Proxy :: Proxy (S (S Z))) (1 :# 2 :# 3 :# Nil)
3
ghci> index (Proxy :: Proxy (S (S Z))) (1 :# 2 :# Nil)
*** Compile error!
~~~

It's an error, but remember, it's a *compiler* error, that happens before any
code is ever even run!  No more indexing errors at runtime!  Kiss your days of
hunting segfault errors in C goodbye!

::::: {.note}
**Aside**

This is something I haven't really been able to find a good answer too.  But
notice that we actually could have written a "bad" instance of the second
instance of `Index`:

~~~haskell
instance Index (S n) (Vec (S m)) where
    index _ (x :# _) = x
~~~

And this compiles fine...but gives the wrong behavior, or at least the
behavior we don't want!

Does anybody know a way to state the type of `Index` or `index` in a way that
implementations like this are impossible?

There's a "fundamental" problem here, it seems, because we can't really demand
or specify anything by the return type, like we could in the other examples.
In the other examples, we sort of restricted the implementation by choosing
our return type carefully...but for here, it's just `a`.  I'd love to hear if
anyone has any thoughts on this.
:::::

You might notice that it's a bit of a plain to write `S (S (S (S Z)))`, etc.,
especially for large numbers.  And I wouldn't even think about writing it for
the hundreds.

We'll "fix" this in the next section.  However, even before this, you actually
can generate these "automatically" with template haskell, using techniques
from [Functional Pearls: Implicit Configurations][fpic], and the [linear][]
package does just this.  (This path slipped my mind before I posted because I
didn't really consider template Haskell, and I think I'll edit in a section
here soon).  With this in mind, I still don't really consider Template Haskell
an optimal or clean approach :)

Using TypeLits and Type Checker Plugins
---------------------------------------

(This next section uses code that is [also available online][fvtypelits], as
well!)

!!![fvtypelits]:fixvec/FVTypeLits.hs

Using a custom `Nat` kind and *DataKinds* is nice and all, but it's a bit of a
hassle to express large numbers like 100, 1000, etc.  However, as of GHC 7.8,
we've had the ability to actually *use* numeric (integer) literals in our
types.  Instead of writing `S (S Z)`, we can write `2`.

GHC can't yet quite work with that well by default.  It has trouble proving
statements about variables, like `(n + 1) ~ (1 + n)` (that `n + 1` is "the
same as" `1 + n`). Fortunately for us, since GHC 7.10, we have a way to
"extend" the type checker with custom plugins that *can* prove things like
this for us.  (Note that this `+` is the one from `GHC.TypeLits`...not the one
we defined earlier.)

The *[ghc-typelits-natnormalise][gtn]* package is a package providing such a
plugin.  We can have GHC use it to extend its type checking by passing in
`-fplugin GHC.TypeLits.Normalise` when we execute our code, or by adding a
pragma:

[gtn]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghc-typelits-natnormalise

~~~haskell
!!!fixvec/FVTypeLits.hs "{-# OPTIONS_GHC -fplugin GHC.TypeLits.Normalise #-}"1
~~~

to the top of our file, along with our `LANGUAGE` pragmas.  (Assuming, of
course, a GHC 7.10+)

~~~haskell
ghci> :set -XDataKinds -XTypeOperators -XTypeFamilies
ghci> import GHC.TypeLits
ghci> Proxy :: ((n + 1) ~ (1 + n)) => Proxy n
*** Compile error: Cannot match `1 + n` with `n + 1`
ghci> :set -fplugin GHC.TypeLits.Normalise
ghci> Proxy :: ((n + 1) ~ (1 + n)) => Proxy n
Proxy   -- success!
~~~

GHC now uses the plugin to prove that the two are really equivalent.

If you wanted to play along or try out the code samples, I recommend you use a
sandbox:

~~~bash
# in directory of your choice
$ cabal sandbox init
$ cabal install ghc-typelits-natnormalise
$ cabal exec bash
# now the package is in scope, when you use ghci or runghc
~~~

With that in mind, let's start restating everything in terms of *TypeLits* and
see what it gains us.

~~~haskell
!!!fixvec/FVTypeLits.hs "data Vec ::" "infixr 5 :#" "deriving instance Show a => Show (Vec n a)"
~~~

A little nicer, right?  `Nil` is a `Vec 0 a`, and `x :# xs` is an element with
a `Vec (n - 1) a`, which overall is a `Vec n a`.  Let's go over everything
again to see how it'd look in the new regime.  (Note that the kind of the type
number literals is also called `Nat`...unrelated to our `Nat` we used before.)

A new look
----------

First of all, we're going to have to define *TypeLit* comparison operators, as
they aren't built in in a useful way.

We have the type family (remember those?) `CmpNat x y`, which returns an
`Ordering` (`LT`, `EQ`, or `GT`) type (of kind `Ordering`, using
*DataKinds*...lifting a type and its value constructors to a kind and its
types), which is provided and defined for us by GHC in `GHC.TypeLits`.

So defining a `x > y` constraint is pretty straightforward:

~~~haskell
!!!fixvec/FVTypeLits.hs "type x > y ="
~~~

Note that we need the *ConstraintKinds* extension for this to work, as `1 > 2`
is now a *constraint*, of kind `Constraint`.

Given this, let's do our favorite list functions, `headV` and `tailV`:

~~~haskell
!!!fixvec/FVTypeLits.hs "headV ::" "tailV ::"
~~~

Magnificent!

~~~haskell
ghci> headV (Nil :: Vec 0 ())
-- Error!  Cannot unite 'EQ with 'GT
~~~

Neat!  The error, remember, is at *compile time*, and not at runtime.  If we
ever tried to do an unsafe head, our code wouldn't even *compile*!  The error
message comes from the fact that we need $n > 0$, but we have $n = 0$ instead.
We have `EQ`, but we need `GT`.

There is one problem here, though --- GHC gives us a warning for not pattern
matching on `Nil`.  But, if we do try to pattern match on `Nil`, we get a type
error, like the same one we got when using our custom type nats.  I think this
is probably something that a plugin or sufficiently smart `CmpNat` might be
able to handle...but I'm not totally sure.  Right now, the best thing I can
think of is just to do a wildcard match, `headV _ = error "What?"`, knowing
that that case will never be reached if your program compiles successfully.

Moving on, we see that we don't even have to do any extra work to define our
own type family `x + y`...because `GHC.TypeLits` already defines it for us!
So, we can instantly write....

~~~haskell
!!!fixvec/FVTypeLits.hs "appendV ::"
~~~

~~~haskell
ghci> let v1 = 1 :# 2 :# 3 :# Nil
ghci> let v2 = iterateU succ 0 :: Vec 2 Int
ghci> v1 `appendV` v2
1 :# 2 :# 3 :# 0 :# 1 :# Nil
ghci> :t v1 `appendV` v2 :: Vec 5 Int
v1 `appendV` v2 :: Vec 5 Int
~~~~

And our list generating typeclasses ---

~~~haskell
!!!fixvec/FVTypeLits.hs "instance Unfoldable (Vec 0)" "instance (Unfoldable (Vec (n - 1)), n > 0) => Unfoldable (Vec n)"
~~~

The translation is pretty mechanical, but I think that this new formulation
looks...really nice, and really powerful.  "If you can build a list from
$n - 1$ and $n > 0$, then you can build a list for $n$!

Note that because our definitions of `replicateU`, `iterateU`, and
`fromListMaybes` was polymorphic over all `Unfoldable`, we can actually re-use
them from before:

~~~haskell
ghci> iterateU succ 1 :: Vec 3 int
1 :# 2 :# 3 :# Nil
ghci> iterateU succ 1 :: Vec 10 Int
1 :# 2 :# 3 :# 4 :# 5 :# 6 :# 7 :# 8 :# 9 :# 10 :# Nil
ghci> replicateU 'a' :: Vec 4 Char
'a' :# 'a' :# 'a' :# 'a' :# Nil
~~~

The actual types are much nicer, too --- we can write `Vec 10 Int` instead of
`Vec (S (S (S (S (S (S (S (S (S (S Z)))))))))) Int` without resorting to
template haskell.

Going through all of our other typeclasses/functions and making the
adjustments... (remembering that we can also derive `Functor`, `Traversable`,
and `Foldable` using GHC)

~~~haskell
!!!fixvec/FVTypeLits.hs "instance Functor" "instance Applicative" "instance (Applicative" "instance Foldable" "instance (Foldable" "instance Traversable" "instance (Traversable" "class Index" "instance (m > 0)" "instance forall n m." "instance (Unfoldable (Vec n), Traversable (Vec n)) => L.IsList (Vec n a)"
~~~

(Remember, we use the `forall` here with *ScopedTypeVariables* to be able to
say that the `n` in the type signature is the same `n` that is in the type of
`Proxy`)

~~~haskell
ghci> fromListU [1,2,3,4] :: Vec 10 Int
Nothing
ghci> fromListU [1,2,3,4] :: Vec 3 Int
Just (1 :# 2 :# 3 :# Nil)
ghci> index (Proxy :: Proxy 2) (1 :# 2 :# 3 :# Nil)
3
ghci> index (Proxy :: Proxy 2) (1 :# 2 :# Nil)
*** Type Error: Couldn't match 'EQ with 'GT
ghci> :set -XOverloadedLists
ghci> [1,2,3] :: Vec 2 Int
1 :# 2 :# Nil
ghci> [1,2,3] :: Vec 4 Int
*** Exception: Demanded vector from a list that was too short.
ghci> [1,3..] :: Vec 5 Int
1 :# 3 :# 5 :# 7 :# 9 :# Nil
~~~

I think, overall, this formulation gives a much nicer interface.  Being able
to just write $10$ is pretty powerful.  The usage with *OverloadedLists*  is
pretty clean, too, especially when you can do things like `[1,3..] :: Vec 10
Int` and take full advantage of list syntax and succinct vector types.
(Minding your runtime errors, of course)

However, you do again get the problem that GHC is not able to do real
completeness checking and asks for the `Nil` cases still of everything...but
adding a `Nil` case will cause a type error.  The only solution is to add a
`_` wildcard chase, but...again, this isn't quite satisfactory.[^thsolve]  If
anybody has a way to get around this, I'd love to know :)

[^thsolve]: Interestingly enough, I think this is something where you could
have the best of both situations with the Template Haskell method.  But I'd
hope for something that works on the beautiful TypeLits :'(

Alternative Underlying Representations
--------------------------------------

Recall that our `Vec` was basically identically the normal list type, with an
extra field in the type.  Due to type erasure, the two are represented exactly
the same in memory.  So we have $O(n)$ appends, $O(n)$ indexing, etc.  Our
type is essentially equal to

~~~haskell
newtype Vec :: Nat -> * -> * where
    VecList :: [a] -> Vec n a
~~~

For this type, though, we'd need to use "smart constructors" and extractors
instead of `1 :# 2 :# Nil` etc.

We could, however, chose a more efficient type, like `Vector` from the
*[vector][]* package:

[vector]: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector-0.10.12.2/docs/Data-Vector.html#t:Vector

~~~haskell
newtype Vec :: Nat -> * -> * where
    VecVector :: Vector a -> Vec n a
~~~

And, if you made sure to wrap everything with smart constructors, you now have
*type safe* $O(1)$ random indexing!

(This is representation is similar to the one used by the *[linear][]*
package.)

More Operations
---------------

One really weird quirk with this is that many functions you'd normally write
using pattern matching you'd now might start writing using typeclasses.  One
example would be our implementation of indexing, using an `IndexV` typeclass.

A bunch of one-shot typeclasses is sort of unideal, as typeclasses are sort of
ugly and non-first-class.  Ideally you'd only have a few typeclasses for as
generic an interface as possible, and then be able to do everything from
those.  Sometimes this just isn't practical.  I did mention one way around it,
which was to make a typeclass to "reify" or turn your type into actual data,
and then manipulate your data in an "unsafe" way knowing that the type checker
checked that the data matched.

We'll demonstrate with `SomeNat` from `GHC.TypeLits`, but you can also make
our own for our inductive `Nat` type we used in the first half, too.

If we use our "wrapped `Vector` approach", we can just do:

~~~haskell
newtype Vec :: Nat -> * -> * where
    Vec :: Vector a -> Vec n a

index :: (KnownNat n, m > n) => Proxy n -> Vec m a -> a
index p (Vec v) = v ! fromInteger (natVal p)
~~~

That is, `index` internally uses `(!)`, an unsafe operator...but only after we
assure properly that it's safe to use by stating `m > n` in the constraint. We
can be sure that GHC will catch any instance where someone tries to index into
a `Vec m a` whose `m` is *not* greater than the index desired.

The rest is up to you, though --- to prove that indexing into a number smaller
than `m` will always provide an answer.  We have to make sure our smart
constructors are okay and that `(!)` behaves like we think it does.

Singletons
----------

Another answer to these sort of ad-hoc typeclasses is to use techniques
involving singletons.  Going all into how to use singletons to work with these
is an article on its own...luckily, this article has already been written as
[Part 1: Dependent Types in Haskell][singletons] by Hiromi ISHII.  A major
advantage is that you replace typeclasses with type families and more
parameterized types.  You'll have to work with an understanding of how
singletons work, and accept using some template haskell to generate singleton
types for your data types (or write them yourself!).  But it's a powerful way
to bring something like dependent types into Haskell, and there's already a
lot of infrastructure of support on it on hackage and in the haskell dev
ecosystem in general.  I recommend looking at the linked article!

Conclusion
----------

Hopefully you'll see that we are able to apply the full type-safety of the
Haskell compiler to our programs regarding lists by encoding the length of the
list in its type and limiting its operations by specifically typed functions
and choice of instances.  I also hope that you've been able to become familiar
with seeing a lot of GHC's basic type extensions in real applications :)

Includes interactive visualizations and simulations! This is a story about breaking the degenerate hyper-dimensional game of life by exploratory visualizations and math! Let’s travel back in time: t’was the night before December 17, 2020, The release of “Conway Cubes”, day 17 of the “Advent of Code” (fun little coding puzzles building up to Christmas). One part about Advent of Code I’ve always found especially fun is that, because the problems are so self-contained and tidy, they are often open-ended in the interesting ways you can solve them or expand them. On the surface, Day 17 seemed to essentially be a straightforward extension of Conway’s Game Of Life (“GoL”). GoL is a simulation played out on a 2d grid, where cells are “on” and “off”, and at each step of the simulation, the on/off cells spread and propagate in fascinating ways based on the state of their neighbors. The twist of the Advent of Code puzzle is it asks what would happen if we played out the rules of GoL in 3d, and then 4d! The “starting conditions” are a 8x8 2D grid picked out for each participant, and the puzzle solution is the number of live cells after six steps. My personal starting conditions were: #####..# #..###.# ###..... .#.#.#.. ##.#..#. ######.. .##..### ###.#### I submitted my answer with a direct implementation (scoring the 66th spot on the leader board for that day)…and that was that for the “competitive” part. But the real fun always starts after! When discussing with some friends, we started talking about the trade-offs of different implementations and realized that the extra dimensionality was no joke…as you upped the number of dimensions, the number of points you have to consider grow as O((2t+6)^d), and the number of neighbors of each point to check grows as O(3^d). So for 4D it’s definitely possible to solve naively…but anything higher is going to strain. My naive solution on 6D took three minutes, and 7D in a reasonable amount of time (612,220,032 points with 2,186 neighbors each) seemed impossible on commercial consumer hardware because of the sheer number of points in 7D space. But I thought…what if a breakthrough in optimization was possible? I set my goal as 10D (3,570,467,226,624 points with 59,048 neighbors each), not knowing if it was possible."><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="og:title" content="Degenerate Hyper-Dimensional Game of Life"><meta property="og:image" content="https://blog.jle.im/img/site_logo.jpg"><meta property="og:locale" content="en_US"><meta property="og:url" content="https://blog.jle.im/entry/degenerate-hyper-dimensional-game-of-life.html"><meta name="twitter:card" content="summary"><meta name="twitter:creator:id" content="mstk"><link rel="author" href="https://plus.google.com/107705320197444500140"><link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="in Code (RSS Feed)" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/incodeblog"><link rel="canonical" href="https://blog.jle.im/entry/degenerate-hyper-dimensional-game-of-life.html"><link href="https://blog.jle.im/favicon.ico" rel="shortcut icon"><link href="https://blog.jle.im/css/toast.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"><link href="https://blog.jle.im/css/font.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"><link href="https://blog.jle.im/css/main.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"><link href="https://blog.jle.im/css/page/entry.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"><link href="https://blog.jle.im/css/pygments.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"><script type="text/javascript">var page_data = {};

<p>This is a story about breaking the degenerate hyper-dimensional game of life by exploratory visualizations and math! Let’s travel back in time: t’was the night before December 17, 2020, The release of <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/17">“Conway Cubes”</a>, day 17 of the “Advent of Code” (fun little coding puzzles building up to Christmas). One part about Advent of Code I’ve always found especially fun is that, because the problems are so self-contained and tidy, they are often <em>open-ended</em> in the interesting ways you can solve them or expand them.</p>
<p>On the surface, Day 17 seemed to essentially be a straightforward extension of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway’s Game Of Life</a> (“GoL”). GoL is a simulation played out on a 2d grid, where cells are “on” and “off”, and at each step of the simulation, the on/off cells spread and propagate in fascinating ways based on the state of their neighbors.</p>
<p>The twist of the Advent of Code puzzle is it asks what would happen if we played out the rules of GoL in 3d, and then 4d! The “starting conditions” are a 8x8 2D grid picked out for each participant, and the puzzle solution is the number of live cells after six steps. My personal starting conditions were:</p>
<pre><code>#####..#
#..###.#
###.....
.#.#.#..
##.#..#.
######..
.##..###
###.####</code></pre>
<p>I submitted my answer with a direct implementation (scoring the 66th spot on the leader board for that day)…and that was that for the “competitive” part. But the real fun always starts after! When discussing with some friends, we started talking about the trade-offs of different implementations and realized that the extra dimensionality was no joke…as you upped the number of dimensions, the number of points you have to consider grow as <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?O%28%282t%2B6%29%5Ed%29" alt="O((2t+6)^d)" title="O((2t+6)^d)" />, and the number of neighbors of each point to check grows as <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?O%283%5Ed%29" alt="O(3^d)" title="O(3^d)" />. So for 4D it’s definitely possible to solve naively…but anything higher is going to strain. My naive solution on 6D took three minutes, and 7D in a reasonable amount of time (612,220,032 points with 2,186 neighbors each) seemed <em>impossible</em> on commercial consumer hardware because of the sheer number of points in 7D space. But I thought…what if a breakthrough in optimization was possible? I set my goal as 10D (3,570,467,226,624 points with 59,048 neighbors each), not knowing if it was possible.</p>
<p>And soon…a breakthrough did come! Someone brought up that if we look at the 3d version, we see there’s actually a <em>mirror symmetry</em>! That is, because everything starts off on the xy plane, with z=0, the resulting progression must be symmetrical on both sides (positive and negative z).</p>
<figure>
<img src="/img/entries/advent-gol/life3d.gif" title="d=3 animation u/ZuBsPaCe" alt="" /><figcaption>d=3 animation by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/kfa3nr/2020_day_17_godot_cubes_i_think_i_went_a_bit_too/">u/ZuBsPaCe</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the end that means we only have to simulate one of the “halves”/“quadrants” of the higher-dimensional space, since all “quadrants” are identical! This saves down the number of points by a factor of two for each extra dimension (<img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?O%282%5E%7Bd-2%7D%29" alt="O(2^{d-2})" title="O(2^{d-2})" />). My 7D implementation completed in 6 minutes! 8D still hung forever, though.</p>
<p>Well, it didn’t get us to d=10…but this discovery completely changed how we saw this puzzle. With one breakthrough down, we began to believe that there would be more just around the corner, made possible by our problem’s special degeneracy (that is, that we start on a 2d slice).</p>
<p>Such a dream (as posed in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/kfb6zx/day_17_getting_to_t6_at_for_higher_spoilerss/">this reddit thread I started</a>) turned into a month-long quest of breakthrough after breakthrough, exploiting different aspects of this degeneracy! It was a long, harrowing journey full of sudden twists and turns and bursts of excitement when new innovations came. And in the end, the hopeful question “What if d=10 was possible?” turned into “d=10 in 100ms, d=40 in eight minutes.” I even got d=10 fast enough to run on easily any modern browser — this post includes those simulations! Furthermore, the whole journey became an adventure in the power of visualization combined with abstract thinking.</p>
<p>So, let’s take a deep dive — deeper than you probably ever expected to dive into any particular degenerate starting conditions of a hyper-dimensional game of life :D</p>
<h2 id="the-baseline">The Baseline</h2>
<p>First of all, let’s meet our friend for the rest of this journey. In the drawer below, you can draw (with your mouse) the 8x8 grid you want to simulate for the rest of this post. As you draw, the rest of the visualizations will update to use this as their initial conditions.</p>
<div id="golDrawer">

</div>
<p>And for fun, here’s a 2D vanilla game of life implementation (for six time steps) to test out your creation. I recommend trying out some of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Examples_of_patterns">interesting well-known patterns</a>!</p>
<div id="gol2D">
<p>Please enable Javascript</p>
</div>
<p>Now that that’s there, let’s start at the beginning: what’s the naive, baseline solution?</p>
<p>A reasonable initial thought would be:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Keep a 2D (or 3D, or 4D, etc.) array of booleans.</li>
<li>At each step:
<ol type="a">
<li>Make a fresh copy of the entire space (<img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?O%28n%5Ed%29" alt="O(n^d)" title="O(n^d)" />).</li>
<li>Loop over each item in your array (<img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?O%28n%5Ed%29" alt="O(n^d)" title="O(n^d)" />). Count all of the neighbors (<img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?O%283%5Ed%29" alt="O(3^d)" title="O(3^d)" />) that are <code>true</code> (“alive”), and write to the new array based on the rules table of GoL (2 or 3 neighbors for a live cell stays alive, 3 neighbors for a dead cell turns alive).</li>
</ol></li>
<li>You have a new array! Loop again six times.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sounds reasonable enough! And this does work for the 2D case pretty well (like in the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/11">Day 11 puzzle</a>). However, there are some clear issues when moving into higher dimensions. The size of your array grows exponentially on your dimension, and so does the number of neighbors you’d have to check. And the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality">curse of dimensionality</a> assures us that more and more of that array would become wasted as the proportion of “on” points shrinks to zero for higher dimensions.</p>
<p>Oh, but what’s that? The percentage of “on” points shrinks to zero for higher dimensions? That actually sounds like something we can use to our advantage! The…<em>blessing of dimensionality</em>, I daresay? Because we know the vast majority of our points will be “off”, there’s another method.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Keep a <em>set</em> of points that are “on”.</li>
<li>At each step:
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Initialize a dynamic map (key-value store) of points to integers (this will record the number of live neighbors of each point).</p></li>
<li><p>For each step, iterate over each of your “on” points, expand all of their neighbors <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n_i" alt="n_i" title="n_i" /> (<img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%28O%283%5Ed%29%29" alt="(O(3^d))" title="(O(3^d))" />), and increment the value associated with <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n_i" alt="n_i" title="n_i" /> in your dynamic map.</p>
<p>For example, if the point <code>[2,3]</code> is in your set of live points, you would add increment the map’s values at keys <code>[1,2]</code>, <code>[2,2]</code>, <code>[3,2]</code>, etc.: all 8 neighbors of <code>[2,3]</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Collect your new set of on points: keep all of the keys in your dynamic map corresponding to live points if their integers are 2 or 3, and keep all of the keys in your dynamic map corresponding to dead points if their integers are 3.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li>You have a new set! Loop again six times!</li>
</ol>
<p>I discuss this algorithm much more deeply with actual code in <a href="https://github.com/mstksg/advent-of-code-2020/blob/master/reflections-out/day17.md">my solutions write-up in my Advent of Code reflections journal</a>.</p>
<p>This method nets us a huge advantage because we now only have to loop over the number of items that we know are alive! Any points far away from our set of alive points can be properly ignored. This narrows down our huge iteration space, and the benefits compound with every dimension due to the blessing of dimensionality!<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The nice thing about this method is that it’s easy enough to generalize to any dimension: instead of, say, keeping <code>[x,y]</code> in your set for 2D, just keep <code>[x,y,z]</code> for 3D, or any length array of coordinates. One minor trick you need to think through is generating all <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?3%5Ed-1" alt="3^d-1" title="3^d-1" /> neighbors, but but that’s going to come down to a d-ary <a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-cross">cartesian product</a> of <code>[-1,0,1]</code> to itself.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Let’s see how this looks for the 3D case! To make things easier to see, we can render things in “slices” in 3D space: each grid represents a slice at a different z level (ie, the z=0 square represents all squares <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%3Cx%2Cy%2C0%3E" alt="&lt;x,y,0&gt;" title="&lt;x,y,0&gt;" />). Press “Play” to have the simulation cycle through 6 time steps!</p>
<div id="gol3D">
<p>Please enable Javascript</p>
</div>
<p>In “reality”, each of those 13 slices above are stacked on top of each other in 3D space. You’ll see that most initial conditions will spread out from the center z=0 point, which means they are actually spreading “up and down” the z axis. If you mouse over (or tap), you’ll see the all of the 26 3D neighbors of the point you’re hovering over highlighted in blue — these 26 points form a 3D cube around your mouse once everything is stacked correctly. You can use this cube to help see how the simulation progresses. If your mouse is hovering over a live cell, and there are 2 or 3 live cells highlighted in your cube, it’ll stay alive in the next time step. If your mouse is hovering over a dead cell and there are exactly 3 live cells highlighted in your cube, it will come alive in the next step.</p>

<pre><code>sim642  I wanted to ask this before but forgot: did anyone try to take advantage of the symmetry, e.g. in z axis in part 1?
sim642  Should halve the amount of calculations you have to do
sim642  Only some extra work at the end to differentiate z=0 and z&gt;0 positions to know which to count twice
sim642  And in part 2 I feel like you could also exploit the symmetry in w axis simultaneously</code></pre>

<li id="fn1" role="doc-endnote"><p>There is a small tweak (brought to our attention by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/kfb6zx/day_17_getting_to_t6_at_for_higher_spoilerss/ghmllf8">Peter Tseng</a>) that people often add to this to avoid the costly check of the original set in step 2c: when you iterate over each point, normally you’d increment the eight neighbors’ map values by 1. Instead, you can increment the eight neighbors’ map values by <em>2</em>, and then increment the point itself by 1. Then in the final integer under each key, <code>n / 2</code> or <code>n &gt;&gt; 1</code> gives you the number of neighbors and <code>n % 2</code> (modulo) gives you whether or not that cell was alive.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

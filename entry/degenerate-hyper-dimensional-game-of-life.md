tldr: By exploiting multiple mathematical properties of a "degenerate"
hyper-dimensional game of life, each discovered one-by-one over the course of a
month, we were able to go from "10 dimensions may just barely be possible" to
"10 dimensions in 100ms, 50 dimensions tackled."

This is a story about breaking the degenerate hyper-dimensional game of life!
Let's travel back in time to the night before December 17, 2020: The release of
["Conway Cubes"](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/17), day 17 of the "Advent of
Code" of fun little coding puzzles building up to Christmas. One part I've
always found especially fun is that, because the problems are so self-contained
and tidy, they are often *open-ended* in the interesting ways you can solve them
or expand them.

On the surface, it seems to essentially be a straightforward expansion of
[Conway's Game Of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).
GoL is a simulation played out on an infinite 2d grid, where certain cells are
"on" and "off", and at each step of the simulation, the on/off cells spread and
propagate in fascinating ways.

The twist of the Advent of Code puzzle is it asks what would happen if we played
out the rules of GoL in 3d, and then 4d! The "starting conditions" are a 8x8 2D
grid that every puzzle solver receives their own one of, and to solve the puzzle
you must simulate six steps of GoL for your personal input and count the number
of live cells at the end of it. For example, my xy starting conditions were

    #####..#
    #..###.#
    ###.....
    .#.#.#..
    ##.#..#.
    ######..
    .##..###
    ###.####

After 6 steps for 4-dimensional game of life, I had 2620 total points. I
submitted my answer with a direct implementation (scoring the 66th spot on the
leader board)...and that was that.

Simple enough, right? Afterwards, when discussing with some friends, we started
talking about the trade-offs of different implementations and realized that
dimensionality was no joke...as you upped the number of dimensions, the number
of points you have to consider grow as
![O((2t+8)\^d)](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?O%28%282t%2B8%29%5Ed%29 "O((2t+8)^d)"),
and the number of neighbors of each point to check grows as
![O(3\^d)](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?O%283%5Ed%29 "O(3^d)")... I took
my solution for d=4 and could *barely* churn out d=6 (in three minutes), since
even at d=6 you have to consider 728 neighbors for (potentially) each of the
64,000,000 points. I had a dream that t=6, d=10 just *might* be possible...but
clearly not without some major breakthrough. After all, at d=10, you'd need to
check 59,048 neighbors for potentially each of 10,240,000,000,000 points.

And...a breakthrough soon came. Someone brought up that if we look at the 3d
version, we see there's actually a *mirror symmetry*! That is, because
everything starts off on the xy plane, with z=0 and w=0, the resulting
progression must be symmetrical on both sides.

![d=3 animation by
[u/ZuBsPaCe](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/kfa3nr/2020_day_17_godot_cubes_i_think_i_went_a_bit_too/)](/img/entries/advent-gol/life3d.gif "d=3 animation u/ZuBsPaCe")

This means that we only have to simulate *half* of the points (for each extra
dimension) to get the answer, *halving* the number of points for d=3, saving a
factor of 4 for d=4, saving a factor of 8 for d=5, etc.
(![O(2\^{d-2})](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?O%282%5E%7Bd-2%7D%29 "O(2^{d-2})")).
After implementing this optimization, I was able to run d=7 in under *six
minutes* (and d=8 in 75 minutes).

What's more is that this made us realize that there were potentially more
breakthroughs we could get by exploiting the fact that we are only given a 2d
slice...we didn't know what those could be yet, but suddenly, d=10 seemed
attainable...maybe?

And such a "maybe" (as posed in [this reddit thread I
started](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/kfb6zx/day_17_getting_to_t6_at_for_higher_spoilerss/))
turned into a month-long quest of breakthrough after breakthrough, exploting
different aspects of this 2d degeneracy! It was a long, harrowing journey full
of sudden twists and turns and bursts of excitement when new innovations came.
And in the end, the hopeful question "What if d=10 was possible?" turned into
"d=10 in 100ms, d=40 in eight minutes."

So, let's take a deep dive --- deeper than you probably ever expected to dive
into any particular degenerate starting conditions of a hyper-dimensional game
of life :D

The Baseline
============

So let's start at the very beginning: how do you solve everything without
anything too fancy?

I discuss my basic Haskell method in [this
write-up](https://github.com/mstksg/advent-of-code-2020/blob/master/reflections-out/day17.md)

``` {.haskell}
-- | Given a neighbor set
neighbsSet :: Vector Int -> Set (Vector Int)
neighbsSet = S.fromList . tail . traverse (\x -> [x,x-1,x+1])

neighborMap :: Set (V3 Int) -> Map (V3 Int) Int
neighborMap ps = M.unionsWith (+)
    [ M.fromSet (const 1) (neighbsSet p)
    | p <- S.toList ps
    ]

stepper
    :: Set (V3 Int)
    -> Set (V3 Int)
stepper ps = stayAlive <> comeAlive
  where
    neighborCounts = neighborMap ps
    stayAlive = M.keysSet . M.filter (\n -> n == 2 || n == 3) $
                  neighborCounts `M.restrictKeys` ps
    comeAlive = M.keysSet . M.filter (== 3) $
                  neighborCounts `M.withoutKeys`  ps
```

sim642 I wanted to ask this before but forgot: did anyone try to take advantage
of the symmetry, e.g.Â in z axis in part 1? sim642 Should halve the amount of
calculations you have to do sim642 Only some extra work at the end to
differentiate z=0 and z\>0 positions to know which to count twice sim642 And in
part 2 I feel like you could also exploit the symmetry in w axis simultaneously
